## Syncing Your Fork (Keeping it Updated)

If the original repository has new updates after your fork, you'll need to sync your fork using the sync button located in the root of the project folder on your fork of the GitHub repo.

## Pull Updates

After your fork has been synced, you will need to pull down the recent updates using the command

```bash
git pull
```
